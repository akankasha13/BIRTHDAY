    <h1>Apology Letter</h1>
    <p class="letterName"> My dear Pakhu, </p>
   <p>
     I’m truly sorry that I'll be spending time with Sardar Vallabhai Patel (statue of unity) and not you on this 4th October. Trust me I didnt want this either. We've spent all our bdays together, planned days around
      each other and thats how the day felt complete. Ik you are upset with me bulli, you have every right to be but just know that even though I’ll be away on this family trip, my heart will 100% be with you that day. You deserve nothing less than the brightest, happiest, most love-filled birthday.I’ll make it up to you, I promise.
      <br> When I’m back, we’re going to have our own belated mini-birthday celebration. The Fine dine or Juneja confectionary, the photoshoot, mixing drinks, glossly lips photos, cooking pasta, everything my cutu wants with double the fun, and double the love (because we both know I owe you big time).<br>
      I never meant to hurt you, but yk  (<i> life mei kabhi kabhi ese situation hojate hai </i>) and I want nothing more than to make you smile because watching you smile makes me smile too.<br> Please forgive me and promise me you will celeberate the day with all the zeal and excitment. Your eyes should shine like the 10year old Pakhi's did and does every year, I cant see that fade away everrrr.
      You mean the world to me. Happy Birthday in advance, my Pakhdudiii, my kuchu, my heart, EWWWW. <br>
       I love you endlessly.
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Happy Birthday in advance my bulli
    </p>
    <p>With love always,<br>Tasha ❤️</p>
